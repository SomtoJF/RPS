# Rock Paper Scissors
## About
In this project I chose to remake an old school classic. This involved extensive use of Javascript and of course creativity on my part. This project inspired by "theodinproject" was created in two phases.
### First Stage - Console Stage
This stage was completely built to work only in the console. It gave me a proper understanding of various javascript concepts such as;
* Functions
* Arrays 
* If-else-if statements and For, while loops to name a few.
### Second Stage - Browser Stage
In this stage, the algorithms used in the console game were rewritten to as to dynamically modify the DOM during gameplay. This generally involved tearing down functions and using the logic behind them to create events for the buttons used for playing the game. This stage helped me get a well rounded understanding of;
* DOM Manipulation
* Events
* If-Else statements and Logical Operators to name a few.
