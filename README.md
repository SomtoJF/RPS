# Rock Paper Scissors
## About
In this project I chose to remake an old school classic. This involved extensive use of Javascript and of course creativity on my part. This project inspired by "theodinproject" was created in two phases.
### First Stage - Console Stage
This stage was completely built to work only in the console. It gave me a proper understanding of various javascript concepts such as;
* Functions
* Arrays 
* If-else-if statements and For, while loops to name a few.
### Second Stage - Browser Stage
TBC
